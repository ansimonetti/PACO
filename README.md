# PACO 
## A strategy founder for *BPMN + CPI* 

## Description

In the context of increasingly complex business processes, accurately modeling decision points, their probabilities, and resource utilization is essential for optimizing operations. To tackle this challenge, we propose an extension to the Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) called BPMN+CPI. This extension incorporates choices, probabilities, and impacts, emphasizing precise control in business process management. Our approach introduces a timeline-based semantics for BPMN+CPI, allowing for the analysis of process flows and decision points over time. Notably, we assume that all costs, energies, and resources are positive and exhibit additive characteristics, leading to favorable computational properties. Real-world examples demonstrate the role of probabilistic decision models in resource management. Additionally, weâ€™ve developed a tool that assesses strategy existence based on a timeline-encoded process and a specified threshold

### Solver
PACO is an algorithm that given a *BPMN + CPI*  diagram and a bound impact vector can determine if there exists a feasible strategy such that the process can be completed while remaining under the bound vector.
